## 🚀 How to Run

### 1️⃣ Start the Server

```bash
javac src/Server.java
java src.Server


You should see:

Server started on port 9999...



Open a new terminal (for each client) and run:

javac src/Client.java
java src.Client


You should see:

Connected to the chat server!

3️⃣ Chat Commands

Send message: Type your message and press Enter

Change nickname: /name newNickname

Quit chat: /quit

All messages are broadcast to every connected client.

🔧 Notes

Default server port is 9999. If you get Address already in use, either:

Change the port in Server.java and Client.java

Close any process using port 9999

Start the server before connecting clients.
